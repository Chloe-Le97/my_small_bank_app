# Back-office assignment

This is the simple back-end project to get you started. 

* To start the back-end server, run either `ee.backoffice.assignment.AssignmentApplication` or `gradle bootRun` from the command line
* The server is on port 8080
* The assignment itself is described in _Mini Back office.pdf_

Good luck!
